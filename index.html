<strong class="bigger" id="mains-movies">Top movie:</strong> Avatar. 
    </p>
    <p> <strong class="bigger" id="mains-movies">My experience: </strong>A world of fantasy and imagination. It is a <em>high-quality</em> production film.<p id="important-sentence">Every aspect of the movie was <em class="big">excellent</em> and done in the best way</p>. It was an <strong>interesting experience </strong> for me to watch the film. I enjoyed it so much and was sitting on the edge of my seat all time. Who does not love adventures and unimaginable worlds. It was so realistic that felt myself standing among the actors. I flew with my wings with them and felt a great pleasure. I was not someone watching TV at all. I was an invisible part of the movie watching what is happening without others noticing me. It seemed like a used a virtual reality technology to get in the world of Avatar, but of course i didn't. The movie was thrilling and i <em><strong class="big">highly recommend </strong></em> it to all science fiction lovers who enjoy flying in the heavens.

        Medicine Work </p>
        <p><strong class="bigger" id="mains-music">My experience:</strong> I use this soundtrack as a method to do a shamanic journey. The drumming in the music helps so much do it. This is one of the best ways to meditate and pray for god for me. It is so <em><strong>powerful</strong></em> and has <em><strong> healing </strong></em> properties. Who doesn't like visiting the upper world and take advice from the <em>great spirits</em> out there. <p id="important-sentence">This <em>should</em> be a music for everyone looking for the truth to enter the home of <strong>god</strong></p>. It <em>expanded</em> my consciousness and took it to the next level. I received many answers of questions that i was wondering through <strong>shamanic journeying</strong>. I knew the true nature of reality and got inspirations from <em>divine</em> entities and figures. I had knowledge about exsitence and how the universe works. It is like an <em>infinite</em> book that gives you the opportunities to read the whole existence. My experience is totally <strong class="bigger">ecstatic</strong> and full of pleasure. The music took me to deep <em>higher </em>dimensions and wonderful realms. Until then, i reached a place where it is abstracted from all the dimensions, which is the <em>ancient home of light.</em></p>
